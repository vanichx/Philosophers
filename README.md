# Philosophers
In this project you will be able to solve the dining philosophers problem




The use of u_int64_t (or uint64_t) for data->death_time is related to ensuring that the variable can hold a sufficiently large range of values. u_int64_t is an unsigned 64-bit integer type, which means it can represent values from 0 to 2^64 - 1.

In the context of your program, data->death_time likely represents the time at which a philosopher should die if they haven't finished their meal. Using a 64-bit unsigned integer allows you to represent a wide range of possible death times, which is especially important if your program needs to handle long-running simulations or large time intervals.

Using a smaller data type, like int or u_int32_t, might lead to overflow or issues if the death time is too far in the future. By using a 64-bit unsigned integer, you ensure that the variable can accommodate a broad range of values, making your program more robust and capable of handling various scenarios.
